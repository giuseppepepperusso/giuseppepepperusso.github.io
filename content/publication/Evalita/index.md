abstract: |
  The Conspiracy Theory Identification (ACTI) task is a new shared task introduced at EVALITA 2023. ACTI is based entirely on comments published in conspiratorial Telegram channels and includes two subtasks: (i) Conspiratorial Content Classification, and (ii) Conspiratorial Category Classification. A total of fifteen teams participated, submitting 81 systems. The top-performing models relied on large language models. We discuss the results and draw conclusions about the role of LLMs in detecting and potentially counteracting conspiracy theories and misinformation online.

summary: |
  ACTI at EVALITA 2023 introduced a new shared task on detecting and classifying conspiracy theories in Telegram comments. Results show large language models outperform traditional methods in combating misinformation.
