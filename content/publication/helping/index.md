abstract: |
  In the U.S. Congress, legislators can use active and passive cosponsorship to support bills. We show that these two types of cosponsorship are driven by distinct motivations: backing political allies versus supporting bill content. To analyze this, we develop an Encoder+RGCN (Relational Graph Convolutional Network) model that learns contextualized legislator representations using bill texts and speech transcripts. Our model predicts active and passive cosponsorship with an F1-score of 0.88. We further show that these representations generalize well to the task of predicting voting behavior and are interpretable, revealing key drivers behind legislative behavior.

summary: |
  This paper shows that active and passive bill cosponsorship in the U.S. Congress reflect different motivations: loyalty to political allies versus content-based support. An Encoder+RGCN model predicts cosponsorship and generalizes to voting behavior.
