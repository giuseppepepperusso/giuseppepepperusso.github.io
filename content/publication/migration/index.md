abstract: |
  The proliferation of radical online communities and their violent offshoots has sparked great societal concern. However, the current practice of banning such communities from mainstream platforms has unintended consequences: (i) the further radicalization of their members in fringe platforms where they migrate; and (ii) the spillover of harmful content from fringe back onto mainstream platforms. Here, in a large observational study on two banned subreddits, r/The_Donald and r/fatpeoplehate, we examine how factors associated with the RECRO radicalization framework relate to users’ migration decisions. Specifically, we quantify how these factors affect users’ decisions to post on fringe platforms and, for those who do, whether they continue posting on the mainstream platform. Our results show that individual-level factors, those relating to the behavior of users, are associated with the decision to post on the fringe. We further show that certain behavioral patterns correlate with continued dual-platform activity, suggesting that migration does not entail full disengagement from the mainstream.

  We study the migration decisions of users from banned radical communities and their continued presence on mainstream platforms. Using the RECRO framework, we show that user-level behavior predicts who migrates to fringe platforms and who stays active across both ecosystems.
