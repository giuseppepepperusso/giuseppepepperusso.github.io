## About Me

Hi, I’m Giuseppe—but you can call me Peppe. I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the [DLab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, advised by [Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/), and currently visiting the [SALT group](https://saltlab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University under the guidance of [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/).

My research is guided by a central question:  
**How can data-driven methods help us *understand*, *simulate*, and *improve* the way communities function in digitally mediated environments?**

I’ve explored this question through high-stakes, high-impact scenarios—spanning the impact of content moderation in social media, sustainability practices on university campuses, and critical organizational choices.

To tackle these challenges, I’ve developed methods from causal inference to uncover underlying social mechanisms, and from large language models to assess how closely AI systems can replicate human decisions. 

If you are interested, let's talk!!
