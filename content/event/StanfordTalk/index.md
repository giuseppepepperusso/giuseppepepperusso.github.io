summary: When AI Shapes Our Choices--The Promise and Peril of Language Models as Decision-Making Companions
abstract: 'Large Language Models are no longer just tools. We increasingly treat them as companions in our decision-making, quietly influencing how we act, judge, and choose. But what happens when these systems become part of decisions that affect not just convenience, but fairness, values, and society? In this talk, I explore the dual nature of LLMs through two real-world experiments. First, I illustrate their promise: LLM-generated messages can successfully nudge individuals toward better choices, increasing the adoption of sustainable food options by 17%. Then, I uncover their risks: in the context of scientific peer review, papers receiving AI-generated reviews are up to 5% more likely to be accepted, raising concerns about potential biases and systemic unfairness. Finally, I turn to one of the most consequential domains\: moral decision-making. Using a large dataset of real-world ethical dilemmas, I reveal that LLMs often diverge from human reasoning by expressing narrower, less diverse moral values—what I call the pluralistic gap. As these companions gain influence, we must ask: are they reflecting us—or quietly reshaping us?'
